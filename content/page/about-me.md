Well, nothing fancy to say here. 

My name is **Pavel Tumilovich** and I'm from Russia (snow, bears, vodka and beautiful blonde girls) and I'm just an ordinary programmer who thinks that starting a blog is a great idea <i class="fa fa-smile-o" 
aria-hidden="true"></i>

The primary focus of my blog is post some programming articles (Java, Rust, microservices, microcontrollers, etc...) along with my **very valuable** ideas here. You know, just to save it for the future.

Also, don't mind my imperfect English <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>. Historically in Russia we have a certain problems with it (articles, way too many tenses ...) to say the least.
